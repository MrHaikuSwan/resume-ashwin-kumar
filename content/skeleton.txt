High-Level structure info:
- master.tex is intended to be a really long resume with everything I could possible want to put on a resume written out

Notes:
- should revisit section header names
- should decide what I want to do with freshman year research
- should decide what I want to do with extracurricular fields instead of projects
- should definitely write some project subheadings
    - unclear if this will help that much given work experience
- should maybe take Maize Mirchi off?
    - nah

Nitpicks:
- Why is the right margin larger for subheadings than it is for section headings?
    - fixed
- Decide if I should add more things to my contact information
    - PERSONAL WEBSITE WHEN I FINISH IT
- Decide if I should try to make the FontAwesome icons lower to account for the underlines under each of my pieces of contact info
    - Don't worry about it
- City & date is more indented than the margin for bullets
    - Fixed
- Space after Pitch Perfect! (but save the !)
    - Fixed
- Italics font is a bit hard to read
    - Fixed
- Might want to find a sans serif font for the whole thing\
    - Fixed
- Pick a better font
    - Fixed
